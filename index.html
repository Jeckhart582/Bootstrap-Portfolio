                            While Jason always struggled in school, he had a certain knack for using and maintaining desktop computers. This hobby, which
                            started from simply playing video games and being exposed to the technology, blossmed into a passion. Afer the fail stint at college,
                            Jason tried his hands at several things. Working operations at Guitar Center led to playing in a band, which led to going on tour. After
                            which he fell in to a cooking job that continues to last for nearly a decade.

                            Getting bored with life and frustrated with the service indursty, Jason began looking for something new. That is when
                            he saw an add on reddit for a web design course at KU. A combination of frustration at his job, the hunger of knowledge,
                            and the dissatisifaction of his past school performance motivated him to turn a new page and enroll. While he finds the pace
                            of the course challenging, he is enjoying it immensly. While the work is hard, it is rewarding and hardly feels like the work
                            he is used to.
